# SIEM-LAB

## Creating a SIEM on Azure using MS Sentinel

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios (in this case with RDP 3389). This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned
